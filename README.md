# About me

![Backgroud](/DSCF1818.jpeg)

My name is Feifei. I come from China but now live in Sweden. I blogged when I was studying in the university for more than 10 years ago, when MySpaces were still popular. I want to start blogging again in the middle of the pandemic and my potential 'mid-age crisis'. Mainly to force myself to document courses and projects I'm doing in order to steer my career into the AI niche. But I will also use it to take notes/write review on books that I have been reading, use it a memo.
